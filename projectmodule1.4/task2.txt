I would think that performance measures the service points performance would be  maintained/updated/computed by them.
So for example a banker would keep time of how much work he has done during the day.

performance measures maintained/updated/computed by service point would then be:
    B,C,A and maybe T Naturally measures derived from these (U,X,S) would also be.

performance measures maintained/updated/computed by the customer would then be:
    Ri and W

performance measures maintained/updated/computed by both: R and N
