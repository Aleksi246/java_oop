I could make a for loop in which an age value is generated based on the distribution.

if the age probability was: 10% 18yo,
                            40% 19yo,
                            50% 20yo

code would be something like:

lista = []
for 1000
    rand = random value from 0 to 1

    if  0 < rand < 0.1
        add 18 to lista
    if  0.1 < rand < 0.5
        add 19 to lista
    if  0.5 < rand < 1
        add 20 to lista
